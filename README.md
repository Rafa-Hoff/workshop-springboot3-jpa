# Objectives
- Create a Spring Boot Java project
- Implement domain model
- Structure logical layers: resource, service, repository
- Configure test database (H2 database)
- Increment database
- CRUD: Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete
- Exceptions treatment

# About the project
My third academic project in [Professor Nelio Alves](https://www.udemy.com/course/java-curso-completo/) Java course.

This is a back-end application implemented by layers, using PostgreSQL as database.
The resource layer is the REST controllers, they will be the application interface with the 
back-end, and will receive requests to respond based on the system behavior. 
There is also the service layer and the data access layer, and they will interact with the entities.

unfortunately, I still can't run the application in the cloud using Heroku.
